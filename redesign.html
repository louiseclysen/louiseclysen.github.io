        	<h1>Redesign of the Control Centre</h1>
            <p>We got the brief to redesign a daily mobile experience during out Mobile Design module at Hyper Island. After ideating and using a lot of post-its we had a few options of parts we wanted to redesign, like the calendar or the alarm, but at the end we decided to work with the control centre in iOS. Our main reason for choosing it was that we all used it daily. Our main focus was the music player after experiencing what its like wanting to change from podcast to Spotify while out in the cold. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We thought the control centre could be more used friendly and offer more possibilites. In it's current state it lacked function we thoguht would make the experience better, like battery save and multiple music players, and had some åpparts take too much space. Like the AirDrop and AirPlay. So we  put the battery save mode there, and moved the volume. Volume would in this version be accessed by long pressing or force touching the volume icon, or by using the buttons on the side of the phone. AirDrop and AirPlay were taken out, but could easily be place in the line of round icons in the bottom to please the power users.
