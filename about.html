        	<h1>About me.</h1>
            <p>A  23 year old designer born and raised in Stockholm, Sweden. I left home for three years between 2012 and 2015 to study Graphic Design at Dalarna University, which gave me loads of print design experience as well as a foundation in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I graduated in June 2015 with a lot of knowledge of print design, but as I was finishing of my last semester I felt I was lacking in the digital department. So I applied to Hyper Islands Mobile Creative program and started studying again in August 2015. All this studying have also given me plenty of time to make my mistakes, I have already put the wrong date on the invitations and built that crappy website.

            <br>
           At Hyper Island I have really developed as a designer, but also as a team member and person. It have helped me focus on what I want to work with in the future, and most importantly how I want to work. 
           	<br>
           	<br>
           I am now starting my second semester at Hyper Island, which is also my last before I go out on internship, and I am thinking more and more on where I want to be in the future. In three years I want to be a designer working with both print and digital design somewhere where I can work both alone and in a close team. I want an workspace that is open to give and receive constructive feedback, innovation, discussions and plenty of fun. An office where I can bring my cat Simon would also be a plus.
